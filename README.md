3-minute story:

Pitchfork, an American online music magazine, claims to be the most trusted voice in music. We are skeptical of this claim and want to evaluate it from a rhetorical standpoint, in terms of their ethos, pathos, and logos. In simpler terms, we want to look at their credibility as a reviewer, their use of emotions in the reviews and whether or not their reviews are logically convincing enough to persuade the general public.

One would expect that a credible reviewer has a good command of language. We will use the Flesch reading-ease score as a proxy and compare the Pitchfork reviews with other sources such as Rolling Stone music magazines and YouTube music video comments. We expect a credible reviewer to be impartial and to assess this we will run a sentiment analysis on these different sources and make a comparison on the presence of emotions in the reviews. Finally, if Pitchfork is logically convincing then we expect some meaningful correlation between their review scores for an album and how well the album performs in billboards or charts.

Big Idea:

Pitchfork claims to be the most trusted voice in music but we are skeptical of this claim and will evaluate their trustworthiness from a rhetorical point of view.
